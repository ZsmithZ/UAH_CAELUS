# UAH CAELUS Mission - Link Analysis & Availablility Study in Uranus System

## Overview of Project
This project aims to develop a link analysis and availability framework to evaluate the communication link between two nodes: 
  - Surface Node: An experimental payload operating on the face of the Uranian Moon, Titania.
  - Orbital Node: Spacecraft in HEO around Uranus.

The resulting link characterization will drive hardware selection and mission design parameters. 

## Mission Parameters Addressed
The link analysis investigates and trades the following parameters critical for end-to-end performacne.
- Freq Selection
- Data rate and Bandwidth
- Antenna and Aperture Sizing
- Beamwidth and pointing
- Link Budget (EIRP, G/T, System Noise)
- Availability Analysis (Look angles)
- System Constraints
